# Node.js Backend Project Setup

Welcome to our Node.js backend project! This guide will help you set up the project and understand the folder structure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Project Structure

The project follows a specific folder structure to organize code and resources efficiently.

### .gitignore

We've provided a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files and directories from version control. Make sure to follow it.

### src

The `src` directory contains the source code for your application. This is where you will spend most of your time developing.

You can also make your folder structure as simple as you like.

You would probably use some of the below files or folder for this project:

- **index.js or server.js**: Entry point for the application.
- **routes**: Define your API routes here.
- **controllers**: Business logic for your routes.
- **models**: Database models and schema.

### node_modules

This directory is created by npm and contains all the project dependencies.

- after you install any package into this node folder, the node_modules folder will be auto generated

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Set up your node package:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
3. Install the library and package you need for the project
   ```bash
   npm install <package_name>
   ```
